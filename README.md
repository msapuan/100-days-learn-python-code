## About

This repository represents my dedicated 100-day learning challenge to master Python programming. Each day's code showcases practical implementations of new concepts, best practices, and evolving problem-solving skills.

**Purpose:**
- Document my learning progression systematically
- Build a portfolio of Python implementations
- Reinforce concepts through consistent daily practice
- Create a resource for fellow Python learners

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this 100-day journey, I'm focusing on:

- **Fundamentals** (Days 1-20): Variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions
- **Data Structures** (Days 21-35): Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, comprehensions
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Days 36-50): Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **Advanced Topics** (Days 51-75): File I/O, exception handling, decorators, generators
- **Practical Applications** (Days 76-100): APIs, databases, web frameworks, real-world projects

## Project Structure

```
100-days-python/
├── day01.py                 # Band Name Generator
├── day02.py                 # [Coming Soon]
├── day03.py                 # [Coming Soon]
├── ...
├── day100.py                # [Final Capstone Project]
└── README.md
```

Each daily file is self-contained and includes:
- Clear comments explaining the logic
- Input/output examples
- Problem statement or objective
- Lessons learned (where applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git for version control
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-python.git
   cd 100-days-python
   ```

2. **Verify Python installation:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### Running the Code

To run any day's script:

```bash
python day01.py
```

Each script is executable individually without external dependencies unless otherwise specified.

## Progress

| Phase | Days | Topics | Status |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Fundamentals | 1-20 | Basics, Data Types, Control Flow | 🟡 In Progress |
| Data Structures | 21-35 | Collections, Comprehensions | ⚪ Upcoming |
| OOP | 36-50 | Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism | ⚪ Upcoming |
| Advanced Concepts | 51-75 | Decorators, Context Managers, Generators | ⚪ Upcoming |
| Real-World Projects | 76-100 | Practical Applications & Integration | ⚪ Upcoming |

## Code Examples

### Day 01: Band Name Generator
*A simple program that generates creative band names based on user input.*

```python
# Input: City name and pet name
# Output: A unique band name combination
```

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Input/Output operations
- String concatenation
- User interaction

## Key Features

✅ **Progressive Difficulty** - Each day builds upon previous knowledge  
✅ **Well-Documented Code** - Clear comments and explanations  
✅ **Real-World Applications** - Practical implementations, not just theory  
✅ **Best Practices** - Clean code, proper formatting, PEP 8 compliance  
✅ **Version Control** - Git history showing daily commits  

## Development Philosophy

1. **Consistency** - Daily practice builds proficiency
2. **Comprehension** - Understanding concepts, not just copying code
3. **Documentation** - Clear comments for future reference
4. **Improvement** - Each iteration uses improved techniques
5. **Sharing** - Contributing to the learning community

## Resources & References

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [Python Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- Personal annotations and learning notes in each script

## Lessons Learned

*This section will be updated as I progress through the journey to document key insights, pitfalls, and breakthroughs.*

## Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Proper variable naming conventions
- ✅ Code comments and docstrings
- ✅ DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Function decomposition
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Type hints (where applicable)
- ✅ Following PEP 8 guidelines

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add unit tests for complex scripts
- [ ] Implement type hints across all modules
- [ ] Create jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- [ ] Add visualization of learning progress
- [ ] Build a web dashboard showcasing projects
- [ ] Create tutorial documents for complex topics

## Contributing
